Project Name
Animal Classifier with Flask API
Overview:

This project utilizes a ResNet-50 deep learning model trained to classify animals among 15 distinct classes. Leveraging Flask, we've built an intuitive API where users can upload images for instant classification. The results are displayed seamlessly on an HTML page, providing an engaging and interactive experience.

Features:

ResNet-50 Model: Trained on a diverse dataset, our model boasts robust accuracy in classifying animals across 15 categories.
